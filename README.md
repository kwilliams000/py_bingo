# About
Following what I learned from creating a blackjack game in the command prompt, I made a bingo game to also work in the command prompt.

# How to play
1. Run main.py
2. Create a square board by entering the width (defaults to 5x5)
3. Select number of CPU players (0-19)
4. The game begins! Enter Y to play the next round or Q to quit and exit the game at any time
5. Keep playing rounds until someone wins


# To do list
Build the game in a GUI - probably Tkinter to start with.
